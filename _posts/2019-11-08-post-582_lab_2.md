## An Experimental Study of Heat Transfer from a Heated Flat Plate to a Circular Impinging Jet

An experiment is conducted on the heat transfer during the impingement of an air jet onto a heated flat plate. The air jet is located directly above the center point of the plate and is impinging on the plate at a right angle. The goal is to characterize the forced convection heat transfer with Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficients. Further, the effect of Reynolds number and the distance between the nozzle and the plate on the heat transfer rate are also investigated. Increasing the Reynolds number results in an increment in convection heat transfer. Further, increasing the value of $H/d$ also increases heat transfer.
