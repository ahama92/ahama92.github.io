## Experimental Study and Analysis of a 3D Wing with Eppler Cross-Section

The flow characteristics over a wing with constant cross-section are studied experimentally in the low speed wind tunnel. The wing used for the experiment is made of several sections of small spans of an Eppler 85-5 section airfoil. The behaviour of the wing is studied for three different wind velocities and by varying the angle of attack, from -8 to 32 degrees. The lift and drag forces on the wing are measured using an external balance, and these results are used for the calculation of the lift and drag coefficients. The calibration of the external load cell is carried out to reduce the systematic errors in the measurement of lift and drag. Further, the tests are carried out on the wing with different aspect ratios to study its corresponding effect on the generation of the lift and drag on the wing. The results are analysed to understand the phenomenon of the stall and to determine the optimal angle of attack for different wind velocity. The closed loop wind tunnel used to carry out these experiments is not equipped with flow visualization possibility.
