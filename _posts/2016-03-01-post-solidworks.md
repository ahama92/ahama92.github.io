## CAD Design Projects

I utilize Solidworks as my main tool in 3D design.

## Royal Falcon-511
This is a two passenger airplane that I designed based on the [Airplane Design book](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/_/6dAoSAAACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBktLNuuTxAhVRuZ4KHa8CBkwQ7_IDegQICBAC) by Jan Roskam.

## Waste Sorting Device
I designed this device for separating paper, aluminum, glass and plastic garbage. This device uses no electrical sensors.

##  Stem Cell Research
I designed this device for stem cell research. It will be used as a controlled culture environment.

## Some cool car designs
For most of the cars (except for one), I used 2D blueprints to make the 3D model in Solidworks.
