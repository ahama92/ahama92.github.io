## MATLAB Programming
I have been utilizing MATLAB as a main tool in different simulation and app development projects including the following.

## Backgammon
This project implements a dynamic user interface with interesting layouts and a variety of game options such as sounds, showing legal moves, single/double player, statistics and more. Single player mode is where the magic happens. The AI is capable of moving the mouse cursor on its turn to make the correct play. This method is based on scoring all the possible moves and choosing the highest score as the optimal play. The AI tries to make progress and at the same time does not let the user win the game (legally, of course).

## Solar System
This 3D simulation of the solar system starts from the midnight of Feb 20, 2013. It is based on the Newton's second law of motion. The gravitational forces between all the planets are taken into account. If for example we multiply the mass of earth by 10,000 the system will be changed in a horrific way as seen on the bottom image.

## 3D Pendulum
The simulation of single and double pendulums. The number of pendulum parts can be selected in 2D mode by the user. You can choose a pendulum with as many section as you wish.
