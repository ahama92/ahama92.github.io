## Incompressible Laminar Navier-Stokes

The 2 dimensional incompressible, laminar, Navier-Stokes equations are solved on a regular Cartesian numerical grid. The problem is the famous lid driven square cavity at different mesh size and Reynolds numbers.  Space discretization is second order accurate and implicit Euler method of time advancing is utilized for integration in time. Artificial compressibility method is used to couple the momentum equations and the continuity equation. The convergence criteria is for pressure which should be less than $10^{-10}$. Two high order functions are utilized for interpolations, quadratic and cubic interpolations.
