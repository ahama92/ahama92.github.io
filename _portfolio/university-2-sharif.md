### Research Assistant
#### Sep 2014 – Aug 2016
#### Tehran, Iran

- Programming and design of reconfigurable hardware using Vivado Design Suite.
- Hardware and software acceleration of different computational fluid dynamics problems.
- C++ program development for the solution of various finite difference methods.

I utilized Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware for the simulation of different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems. The main goal was to accelerate the simulations and reduce computational time. A clever design of the reconfigurable hardware can provide both high-performance custom computing as well as efficient data flow control simultaneously, which are fundamental to CFD computations. Vivado Design Suite is utilized for hardware design and programming. The results depict the promising future of this approach for the solution of CFD problems with up to 95% computational time reduction in different cases. Four journal papers were published on the results including one in the AIAA Journal.
