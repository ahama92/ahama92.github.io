One of the major challenges with Computational Fluid Dynamics has been the stability deficiencies of the current tools available to the scientific and engineering community. Our proposal describes a scheme to prototype methods for stability analysis and improvement in a framework that can be readily incorporated in current finite-volume CFD solvers. My focus is mainly on industrial-scale 3-dimensional turbulent flows and more complicated large problems. The project, sponsored by ANSYS Canada, will help demonstrate the utility of our approach when applied to different problems in ANSYS Fluent. Mesh optimization through eigenanalysis of the semi-discrete Jacobian matrix of the solution is a key feature of this novel methodology. This approach has proven to be robust when remediating unstable modes of different numerical solutions.
