- MATLAB program development for the solution of fluid and heat transfer inside a commercial aircraft turbofan engine.
- Computational solution speed-up utilizing a one-dimensional numerical solution approach.

I converted the complex three-dimensional fluid and heat transfer equations into simplified one-dimensional relations for the numerical simulation. The technique is known as the network method in which different features of geometry and physics are approximated as data nodes. The correct data input to each node is calculated through a semi-empirical approach. The resulting simulations are much faster than the full 3D solution with acceptable results.
